Here is a brief explanation of how to play the game:

The game will randomly generate a number between 1 and 100.
The player will have 10 tries to guess the number.
After each guess, the game will provide a hint indicating whether the guess was too high or too low.
If the player is unable to guess the number within the allowed tries, the game will reveal the number.
To play the game, simply run the program and enter your guesses when prompted. The game will provide hints
 and keep track of the number of tries you have used. Good luck!
